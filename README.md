**Exploring Netflix Dataset**

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Netflix dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the content available on the platform. My exploration covered a wide range of queries, including statistical summaries, trend analysis, and genre-specific investigations. I utilized SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from the dataset, allowing me to perform complex analyses and answer specific questions.

**Approach:**

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** I began by loading the Netflix dataset into a SQL database and performed initial data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** I conducted exploratory data analysis using SQL queries to understand the distribution of titles across genres, languages, countries, and other attributes. This helped me identify patterns and trends in the dataset.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** I performed statistical analyses such as calculating average IMDb scores, quartiles, and standard deviations to understand the distribution and variability of IMDb scores across different categories such as genres, directors, and countries.

4. **Advanced Queries:** I used advanced SQL techniques such as window functions and subqueries to conduct more complex analyses, including finding top-ranked titles in each genre, identifying directors with the highest variability in IMDb scores, and discovering titles with the longest descriptions.

5. **Visualization:** To complement my analysis, I created visualizations using Tableau and Looker Studio. In Tableau, I visualized trends in IMDb scores over time and compared IMDb scores across different genres. In Looker Studio, I created interactive dashboards to explore the distribution of titles by genre, language, and country.

**Key Insights:**

- I identified directors with the highest and lowest average IMDb scores, providing insights into directorial performance.
- Analysis of IMDb score trends over months revealed seasonal patterns in the release of high-rated titles.
- The distribution of IMDb scores across genres and countries highlighted variations in content quality.
- I identified titles with the longest descriptions, indicating potential areas for content enrichment or summarization.
